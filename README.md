# 3D_Lidar_Visualizer

Is a project developed as a part of a graduation project at Svendborg Tekniske Gymnasium.
The project consists of several parts, both hardware and software, all developed entirely from scratch, for the purpose of education. The project consists of a fully automatic motorised 3D scanner, which utilizes a Garmin Lidar Lite unit to measure precise point distances. These datapoints are then saved in a log file, and visualized as a point cloud in the application in this repository.
